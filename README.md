# Task Tracker CLI 📝

A simple command line program in Python programming language to track your tasks. Beginner level project, however I tried to implement intermediate level code wherever possible. 

## Hello 👋
Thank you for checking my project, it was my first actual project so if you find any mistakes please let me and I will try to imporve it.

Some things to note are that this program relies on some hard-coded code blocks, even though I tried to be as programmatic as possible. At the end of the day, it still is a beginner level project :)


## Usage/Examples 🤔

```python
task-cli: add I need to publish this project.
Output: Task added successfully (ID: 1)

task-cli: list
"""This will list all tasks in 'tasks.json' file"""

task-cli: update 1 I have uploaded this project to GitHub
"""This will update the description of the task 1"""

task-cli: mark 1 done
"""This will change the status of the task 1 to done"""

task-cli: delete 1
"""This will delete task 1"""
```
To see a detailed documentation (beginner level), please refer to the help file in the repository.
